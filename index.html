<p> <font size="+1">As COVID-19 vaccination shots started to be distributed in 2021, each month there has been a rise in box office revenue for the highest-grossing movie. In January, the movie with the highest box office revenue was The Marksman which made $15,566,093. During that time, only 329,795 (1.7%) people were vaccinated out of 392.5 million people in the US. In July, as the COVID-19 vaccine mandate started to take effect, 11,109,858 (57.1%) people were fully vaccinated in the US and were able to go back to doing their regular pre-COVID activities while taking safety precautions. This shows more people became comfortable with going to theaters again as the movie with the highest box office revenue in July was Black Widow which made a whopping $183,651,655. Even as recently as October, Venom: Let there be Carnage made $198,014,024, topping Black Widow as 12,978,653 (66.6%) of people were fully vaccinated in the US. </font></p>

<p> <font size="+1">Alicia Reese, Stock Analyst of Wedbush Securities predicts that in 2023 box office numbers can return to pre-pandemic numbers. "We think optimistically that 2023 box office can return to 2018-2019 levels. With shorten theatrical windows, we have the balance of big-block busters staying in theaters longer. But, on the other end, we have smaller films that would usually go straight to streaming are playing in theaters in a shorten window so, theaters would actually get that revenue."</font></p>
